# NFT666 for PlatON

## Description
Something interesting will be happened in metaverse, but the current standard for non-fungible tokens may not be able to adapt to some interesting situations. For example, if someone wants to lend an exceptionally valuable digital asset in the virtual world, to a friend, the existing standards do not guarantee that his friend will return it.

I believe that in the future metaverse world, the rental of digital assets is a very common situation, so I am ready to study how to provide a better service based on the existing NFT standard.

NFT666 is derived from NFT721(https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721).

Now I'm developing NFT666 for PlatON. I will continue to port and develop the solidity version later.

I hope NFT666 can be a new standard for NFTs in the metaverse.
